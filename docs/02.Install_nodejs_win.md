# Install nodejs on windows

The official installation guide can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

You can also follow this [tutorial](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/#1-download-the-windows-installer) to install `Nodejs` on windows.

## Use fnm to install node
Fast Node Manager (fnm) is a cross platform tool which can help you install Nodejs

You can find their github page [here](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

``` powershell
# Download and install fnm:
winget install Schniz.fnm
```

You need to close and open a new powershell to be able to run the below command

```powershell
# check the fnm version
fnm --version

# expected output
fnm 1.38.1

# Download and install Node.js 22(LTS):
fnm install 22
```

After the above command, the nodejs will be installed in `C:\Users\<uid>\AppData\Roaming\fnm\node-versions\v22.14.0`

You need to create an env var `NODE_HOME` and add it to `path`.

```text
NODE_HOME = C:\Users\PLIU\AppData\Roaming\fnm\node-versions\v22.14.0

# the bin are in `v22.14.0\installation`, so add the below line into path
%NODE_HOME%\installation
```

Repoen a new powershell or cmd, and check the node and npm version

```powershell
node -v

npm -v
```
