# Installing TypeScript
There are two main ways to add TypeScript to your project:

 - Via npm (the Node.js package manager)  
  - By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins

Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript language support by default but does not include the TypeScript compiler, tsc. If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it.

For npm users:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```


## Test your env

```TypeScript
function greeter(person) {
  return "Hello, " + person;
}
 
let user = "Jane User";
 
document.body.textContent = greeter(user);
```
