# Js Hello world

## Insert js code in html

JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the **<script>** tag.
Check the below example.
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
    <title>
        This is js hello world
    </title>
    
</head>
<body>

  <p>Before running the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After running the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

The `<script> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag`.

## Insert larger js code

As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. **More complex ones reside in separate files**.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.

Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.

That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

The below example does exactly the same thing as the above example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
    <title>
        This is js hello world
    </title>

</head>
<body>

<p>Before running the script...</p>

<script src="helloworld.js"></script>

<p>...After running the script.</p>

</body>

</html>

```

> When we use the src attribute in the <script> tag, the tag can no longer host code inside the tag. The below example
> will cause error

```html
<script src="helloworld.js">
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
</script>
```
