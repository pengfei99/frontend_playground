# Create an Electron app

In this document, you will learn how to set up an `Electron project` and write a `minimal starter application`. By the end of this section, you should be able to `run a working Electron app in development mode` from your terminal.

You can find the offcial doc [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app)


## Initializing a npm project

Electron apps are scaffolded using npm, with the package.json file as an entry point. Use the below command to create a npm project

```shell
# create a project folder
mkdir my-electron-app && cd my-electron-app

# init npm project
npm init
```

The `npm init` command will prompt you to configure some fields in your package.json. There are a few rules to follow for the purposes of this tutorial:

- entry point should be main.js (you will be creating that file soon).
- you can choose any value for other parameters

This command will generate:
- package.json: your project metadata for npm to run, build, publish
- node_module: contains bin of dependent packages
- package-lock.json: This lockfile specifies the exact dependency versions to install

## 2. Add electron support

```shell
npm install electron --save-dev
```

After install electron, you should have an updated `package.json` file

```json
{
  "name": "my-electron-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "pengfei liu",
  "license": "MIT",
  "description": "",
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^35.0.2"
  }
}
```
To execute the `main.js` script, add `electron .` to the `start` command in the `scripts` field of the `package.json`. This command will tell the Electron executable to look for the main script in the current directory and run it in dev mode.
So we add a line `"start": "electron ."`
### 2.1 add main.js

To test your app, you can create a simple `main.js`

```js
console.log('Hello from Electron ðŸ‘‹')
```

### 2.2 Test your app

# you can start your app in dev mode with the below command

```shell
npm run start
```
