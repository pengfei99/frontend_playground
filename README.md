# Front end programing play ground

In this repo, we will follow a series of tutorial of frontend technologies. Such as javascript, Typescript, react, vue, nodejs, [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) and more. 

You can find the main doc in [docs](./docs/)


## 1. **What is JS?**
JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

- `ECMAScript` provides the core functionality.
- `The Document Object Model (DOM)` provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
- `The Browser Object Model (BOM)` provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser

When a web page is loaded, i.e., after HTML and CSS have been downloaded, the JavaScript engine in the web browser executes the JavaScript code. The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.

The `JavaScript engine` is a program that executes JavaScript code. In the beginning, JavaScript engines were implemented as `interpreters`.

However, `modern JavaScript engines are typically implemented as just-in-time compilers` that compile JavaScript code to bytecode for improved performance.

**Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript**
When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in web browsers. In this case, JavaScript works as a client-side language.

`JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular JavaScript server-side environment is Node.js`. Unlike client-side JavaScript, `server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.`

## 2. What is typeScript?

TypeScript is a syntactic superset(it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds extra syntaxe) of JavaScript which adds `static typing`.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.



## 2. What is Node.js

**Node.js is an open source server environment which runs JavaScript on the server.**

- Node.js can generate dynamic page content
- Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
- Node.js can collect form data
- Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

**What is a Node.js File?**
- Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
- A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
- Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
- Node.js files have extension ".js"

## 3. What is Electron?

https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites

**Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. By embedding `Chromium and Node.js into its binary`, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux  no native development experience required.

You need to be generally familiar with `Node and front-end web development basics` to start with Electron.
